Pseudo Tests:

1. create bread object
2. 1 loaf of bread is $5
3. total cost = 5 * loafs

4. create pastry object
5. 1 pastry is $2
6. grand total = 2 * pastries

7. incorporate Pierre's promotional costs (buy 2 get 1 free bread, 3 pastries for $5)

8. build UI logic
9. refactor and separate classes into separate files
10. 


--------------------------------
**Actual Tests:**

1. Can I create a new instance of Bread?
2. Can Bread hold a value for total cost and can we get that total cost with dot notation?
