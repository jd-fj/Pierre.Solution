# **Pierre's Bakery**

##### Order bread and pastries from Pierre's!

##### by Taylor Delph

## Description

This is the first independent project for C# at Epicodus. Here is the prompt I was given to build this application: 

_Create a C# console application for a bakery that includes the following functionality:_

- There should be two custom classes: one for Bread and one for Pastry.

- When the user runs the application, they should receive a prompt with a welcome message along with the cost for both Bread and Pastry.

- A user should be able to specify how many loaves of Bread and how many Pastrys they'd like.

- The application will return the total cost of the order.

- Pierre offers the following deals: Bread: Buy 2, get 1 free. A single loaf costs $5. Pastry: Buy 1 for \$2 or 3 for $5.

- All functionality for the models should be tested.
